# OBJECTIVE 

The main objective of the mathworks minidrone competition was to develop an image processing and a path planning algorithm that would enable the drone to autonomously follow the path on the ground. The controller and the dynamics of the drone was to be kept as it is for implementation of the algorithms on real hardware (Parrot Mambo QuadCopter) . 

# Description 

The control system architecture of the Parrot Mambo drone, designed for autonomous path following, is a complex and highly integrated system that combines advanced image processing, path planning, and control mechanisms to enable precise and reliable navigation. This drone, equipped with four brushless DC motors, is specifically engineered to autonomously follow a predetermined path marked by distinct colors, with red representing the path and blue representing the surroundings. The architecture ensures that the drone can successfully navigate through this environment, which includes multiple sharp turns, and ultimately land on a designated target area.

The first critical component of this system is the image processing module, which is responsible for interpreting the visual data captured by the drone’s downward-facing RGB camera. As the drone flies, the camera continuously captures images of the area below it, which are then processed in real-time to identify the path. The primary task of the image processing algorithm is to differentiate between the path (red) and the surrounding area (blue). This involves several stages, including color thresholding, segmentation, and filtering, which work together to isolate the path from the background. By converting the visual data into binary or segmented images, the system can identify the exact location and orientation of the path relative to the drone.

Image processing is crucial because it transforms raw visual data into actionable information that the drone can use for navigation. Without accurate image processing, the drone would be unable to discern the path from its surroundings, leading to potential deviations or even crashes. The robustness of the image processing algorithm is therefore essential to the overall performance of the drone, ensuring that it can operate effectively even in challenging lighting conditions or when the path features complex patterns or sharp turns.

Once the image processing algorithm has successfully identified the path, the next stage in the control system architecture is the path planning algorithm. The role of the path planning algorithm is to use the processed image data to determine the most efficient trajectory that the drone should follow. This involves calculating a series of waypoints that the drone will navigate through, taking into account the path’s geometry, including any sharp turns or obstacles that may be present. The path planning algorithm must ensure that the drone can smoothly transition from one segment of the path to another while maintaining a stable and controlled flight.In this context, the path planning algorithm is essential for guiding the drone along its intended route. It not only ensures that the drone follows the path accurately but also optimizes the flight trajectory to minimize energy consumption and avoid unnecessary maneuvers. The algorithm continuously updates the planned trajectory based on real-time data from the image processing module, allowing the drone to adapt to any changes in the path or unexpected obstacles. This dynamic adaptation is crucial for maintaining the drone’s course and ensuring that it reaches its destination efficiently.

After the path planning algorithm has determined the optimal trajectory, the control system takes over to execute the planned path. The control system is responsible for translating the high-level path information into specific motor commands that adjust the drone’s yaw, pitch, roll, and throttle. This involves precise control of the four brushless DC motors, which must work in unison to maintain the drone’s stability and orientation while navigating the path.The control system relies on feedback from the drone’s onboard sensors, including gyroscopes, accelerometers, and possibly GPS, to monitor the drone’s current state and make real-time adjustments. For instance, if the drone detects that it is drifting off course, the control system will make the necessary corrections by adjusting the motor speeds to steer the drone back onto the path. This closed-loop control mechanism is essential for maintaining the drone’s stability, especially when navigating sharp turns or flying in windy conditions.

The final phase of the drone’s operation is landing, which is also managed by the control system. As the drone approaches the end of the path, the image processing and path planning algorithms continue to provide real-time data to ensure a smooth and precise landing. The control system gradually reduces the drone’s altitude while aligning it with the target landing area, making any necessary adjustments to account for wind or other environmental factors.
